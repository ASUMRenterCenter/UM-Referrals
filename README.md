## Materials for development of a resource database for University of Montana students.

Around the nation, colleges and universities are realizing that students are having difficulty meeting their most basic needs, such as food, housing, and healthcare.

University of Montana students have access to a number of programs when they encounter hard times. But it can be difficult to know what is available and how to access resources. Information & Referral connects people with programs to help them with free and low-cost services to meet their needs.

For this project, students will adapt and deploy an Information & Referral web app that students can use to navigate programs provided by the University of Montana and the Missoula community. There are several open-source options available that can be customized, including a national network of participants, and students contributions may even be added to the original projects.

A finished product should include a web app usable by students and community members, a form where agencies can update their information, and documentation that ensures that the web app can be used after students have moved on.

The web app should use standards recognized in the field of Information and Referral, such as [AIRS style](https://www.airs.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3362) for listings and the [Human Services Data Specification from Open Referral](https://github.com/openreferral/specification). Listings should be organized according to a taxonomy, such as [Open Eligibility](https://github.com/ASUMRenterCenter/openeligibility).

The documentation for this project should be written in a way that is easy for a lay person to understand, and should be published in a format that is easy to update, such as a wiki. Instructional videos are a plus.
